Perfect. The write-up is the easy part if you structure it right. You basically need a short report with four sections: **Requirements & Design**, **Development**, **Testing**, and **Time/Effort Analysis**. Here’s a skeleton you can drop into your doc and fill out with screenshots + code later:

# Calculator Project Write-Up

## 1. Requirements Analysis & Design

* **Goal**: Build a calculator with a user interface that supports:

  * Basic arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
  * Advanced functions (power, trigonometry, logarithm, exponent)
  * Expression evaluation using **OpenAI ChatGPT API** (prompt engineering)
* **Design Choices**:

  * Programming Language / UI framework: *(state your choice, e.g., Python + Tkinter, or Java + Swing, or JS + HTML/CSS)*
  * Expression handling: Input string → send to ChatGPT prompt → numeric output returned
  * Error handling: Division by zero, malformed expressions, invalid characters
  * UI layout: Numeric keypad, operation buttons, function buttons, display field
* **Prompt Template** (example):

  ```
  You are a calculator. Evaluate strictly mathematical expressions.
  Expression: {user_input}
  Return only the numeric result.
  ```

## 2. Development

* **Steps Implemented**:

  1. Setup project environment
  2. Built UI with buttons and display
  3. Integrated OpenAI API for expression evaluation
  4. Implemented basic error handling
  5. Connected UI → backend → output loop
* **Screenshots**: *(insert here)*

## 3. Testing

* **Test Strategy**:

  * Functional testing: verify +, −, ×, ÷, ^, sin, cos, tan, log, exp
  * Edge cases: division by zero, nested functions, malformed input
  * Usability: test button flow and UI responsiveness
* **Defects Found**:

  * Example: “sin(90)” returned in radians instead of degrees
  * Example: Long decimal precision from API → trimmed to fixed digits
* **Fixes Applied**:

  * Clarified prompt to specify radians vs degrees
  * Rounded output in display formatting

## 4. Time & Effort Analysis

* **Initial Estimate**: \~15–20 hours total

  * Requirements & Design: 2–3 hrs
  * Development: 8–12 hrs
  * Testing: 4–5 hrs
* **Actual Time Spent**: *(fill in once complete, with date + hours/day log)*
* **Comparison**:

  * Estimated vs actual total
  * Where more time was spent than expected (e.g., debugging API vs UI polish)

That’s your write-up structure: professional enough to tick every rubric box, minimal fluff, easy to expand with screenshots and logs.

Want me to also give you a **daily log template table** you can just copy into your report and fill as you go?
